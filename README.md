# Advent of Code 2016
My solutions to [Advent of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016)

Most of the puzzles are solved straight when they become available
and before I go to work in the morning, so readability is not a priority.
Don't judge my sometimes bad structure ;)

I started off trying to brush up on my Haskell, but realised that I have
to use Python if I'm going to have any chance of getting to the top 100
some day. We'll see if I can pull it off...
